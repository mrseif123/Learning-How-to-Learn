# Web Project 1&2

My first attempt in the Web-Development world, freshly started learning HTML, CSS & JS to further expand my coding skills tool-box.

This is a simple one-page website built with HTML & CSS only.

Mainly focuses on the following:
1. BEM naming convention for files, elements, blocks and modifiers.
2. Using Flex-Box.
3. Implementing simple animations.
4. Using Embedded content (iFrame).
