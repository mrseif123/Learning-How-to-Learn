                <p class="text description__text">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end
                    up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the
                    test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information
                    will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.</p>
                <p class="text description__text"><span class="span-accent">Here's the real question</span>: does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject
                    material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic
                    is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?

                        efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.</p>
