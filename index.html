            <p class="description__column-paragraph-row">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end
            up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the
            test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information
            will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.</p>
            <p class="description__column-paragraph-row"><span class="description__span-accent">Here's the real question</span>: does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject
            material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic
            is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?</p>
            <p class="description__column-paragraph-row">Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the educational process to help make it more
            efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.</p>
